## ⚡ Quick Start (EmailJS Only)

If you want to launch immediately with EmailJS only (without Gmail OAuth):

1. **Set up EmailJS account** at emailjs.com
2. **Configure environment variables:**
```env
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```
3. **Deploy backend and frontend**
4. **Users can start sending emails immediately**
5. **Work on Gmail OAuth verification in background**

This allows you to launch the core functionality while Google processes your OAuth verification (typically 2-4 weeks).
